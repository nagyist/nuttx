 * Cancellation Points.

 * Cancellation points shall occur when a thread is executing the following

 *
 * accept()          mq_timedsend()           putpmsg()       sigtimedwait()
 * aio_suspend()     msgrcv()                 pwrite()        sigwait()
 * clock_nanosleep() msgsnd()                 read()          sigwaitinfo()
 * close()           msync()                  readv()         sleep()
 * connect()         nanosleep()              recv()          system()
 * creat()           open()                   recvfrom()      tcdrain()
 * fcntl()           pause()                  recvmsg()       usleep()
 * fdatasync()       poll()                   select()        wait()

 * getmsg()          pselect()                sem_wait()      waitpid()

 * mq_timedreceive() putmsg()                 sigsuspend()
 *
 * Each of the above function must call enter_cancellation_point() on entry
 * in order to establish the cancellation point and
 * leave_cancellation_point() on exit.  These functions are described below.
