 * Name: posix_spawn
 *
 * Description:
 *   The posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() functions will create a new,
 *   child task, constructed from a regular executable file.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *
 *   pid - Upon successful completion, posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() will
 *     return the task ID of the child task to the parent task, in the
 *     variable pointed to by a non-NULL 'pid' argument.  If the 'pid'
 *     argument is a null pointer, the process ID of the child is not
 *     returned to the caller.
 *
 *   path - The 'path' argument to posix_spawn() is the absolute path that
 *     identifies the file to execute.  The 'path' argument to posix_spawnp()
 *     may also be a relative path and will be used to construct a pathname
 *     that identifies the file to execute.  In the case of a relative path,
 *     the path prefix for the file will be obtained by a search of the
 *     directories passed as the environment variable PATH.
 *
 *     NOTE: NuttX provides only one implementation:  If
 *     CONFIG_LIBC_ENVPATH is defined, then only posix_spawnp() behavior
 *     is supported; otherwise, only posix_spawn behavior is supported.
 *
 *   file_actions - If 'file_actions' is a null pointer, then file
 *     descriptors open in the calling process will remain open in the
 *     child process (unless CONFIG_FDCLONE_STDIO is defined). If
 *     'file_actions' is not NULL, then the file descriptors open in the
 *     child process will be those open in the calling process as modified
 *     by the spawn file actions object pointed to by file_actions.
 *
 *   attr - If the value of the 'attr' parameter is NULL, the all default
 *     values for the POSIX spawn attributes will be used.  Otherwise, the
 *     attributes will be set according to the spawn flags.  The
 *     posix_spawnattr_t spawn attributes object type is defined in spawn.h.
 *     It will contains these attributes, not all of which are supported by
 *     NuttX:
 *
 *     - POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP:  Setting of the new task's process group is
 *       not supported.  NuttX does not support process groups.
 *     - POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM: Set new tasks priority to the sched_param
 *       value.
 *     - POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER: Set the new task's scheduler policy to
 *       the sched_policy value.
 *     - POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS: Resetting of the effective user ID of the
 *       child process is not supported.  NuttX does not support effective
 *       user IDs.
 *     - POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK: Set the new task's signal mask.
 *     - POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF:  Resetting signal default actions is not
 *       supported.  NuttX does not support default signal actions.
 *
 *   argv - argv[] is the argument list for the new task.  argv[] is an
 *     array of pointers to null-terminated strings. The list is terminated
 *     with a null pointer.
 *
 *   envp - envp[] is an array of character pointers to null-terminated
 *     strings that provide the environment for the new process image.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() will return zero on success.
 *   Otherwise, an error number will be returned as the function return
 *   value to indicate the error:
 *
 *   - EINVAL: The value specified by 'file_actions' or 'attr' is invalid.
 *   - Any errors that might have been return if vfork() and excec[l|v]()
 *     had been called.
 *
 * Assumptions/Limitations:
 *   - NuttX provides only posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() behavior
 *     depending upon the setting of CONFIG_LIBC_ENVPATH: If
 *     CONFIG_LIBC_ENVPATH is defined, then only posix_spawnp() behavior
 *     is supported; otherwise, only posix_spawn behavior is supported.
 *   - Process groups are not supported (POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP).
 *   - Effective user IDs are not supported (POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS).
 *   - Signal default actions cannot be modified in the newly task executed
 *     because NuttX does not support default signal actions
 *     (POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF).
 *
 * POSIX Compatibility
 *   - The value of the argv[0] received by the child task is assigned by
 *     NuttX.  For the caller of posix_spawn(), the provided argv[0] will
 *     correspond to argv[1] received by the new task.
